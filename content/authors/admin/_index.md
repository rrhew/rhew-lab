Robert Rhew (he/him) is a (new) Professor of Geochemistry at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego, starting the summer of 2025. For the prior 20+ years, Rhew was a professor (assistant, associate and full) of trace gas biogeochemistry at the University of California, Berkeley. His research interests include the sources and sinks of gases involved with stratospheric ozone depletion, radiative forcing and air pollution. He led the Atmospheric Biogeochemistry group in the Department of Geography (joint appointment with the Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management), which conducts field and laboratory based measurements of trace gas fluxes and studies of the environmental and biological controls on those fluxes. He is merging this research program with the long-standing and important work of the AGAGE program.
