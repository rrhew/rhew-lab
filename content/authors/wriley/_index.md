William Riley completed his B.A. in 2022 from Vassar College. During his undergraduate years, he conducted biogeochemistry resesarch on Hudson River Foraminifera in the laboratory of Dr. Laura Haynes.  He also was an Ernest Hollings Undergraduate Scholar (NOAA) studying carbon sequestration in coastal Alaskan peat bogs on the Kenai Peninsula. He also conducted ocean biogeochemistry research in Belize, working on coral reefs and impact of sargassum on seawater quality.  After graduation, he worked as an environmental scientist for Athneica Environmental Service on projects involving residual lead paint in public housing.

In Fall 2024, Will joined UC Berkeley's ESPM Department as a graduate student.  He is currently working in the atmospheric biogeochemistry laboratory on several projects, including methane fluxes in wetlands, atmospheric halocarbon measurements, and a new project on soil uptake of trace gases.
