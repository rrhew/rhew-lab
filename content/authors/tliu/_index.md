Tyler Liu graduated from UC Berkeley with a dual degree in chemistry and music, with a concentration in organic materials (metals) for chemistry and musical composition for music. Tyler joined the Atmospheric Biogeochemistry Laboratory for his senior year, in Fall 2023 through Spring 2024. He worked on several projects in the lab, including: 1) characterizing the laser-based instrument that measured CH4, CO2 and CO; 2) cryotrap improvements and testing for the GC-MS; and 3) GC-MS analyses. Tyler is off to do a Masters Degree and will continue his dual passions of music and science.
