Metta joined the Atmospheric Biogeochemistry lab in the Fall of 2019 as part of the URAP Program, and followed up as a Haas scholar for her senior honors thesis research. Her senior thesis, "Analyzing methane emissions from a restored bay area wetland", was conducted amidst the challenges of the pandemic.  For this research, she collected soil cores at the Sherman Island restored wetland and conducted core incubations in the laboratory to measure fluxes of methand and carbon dioxide.
