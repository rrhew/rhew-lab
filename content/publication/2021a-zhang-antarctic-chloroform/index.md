abstract: In this study, the first in situ static-chamber measurements were
  conducted at coastal Antarctica tundra for CHCl3 fluxes, which showed that
  CHCl3 was naturally emitted from the Antarctic tundra at 35 ± 27 nmol m−2 d−1,
  comparable to other reported important natural sources. Significantly,
  enhanced CHCl3 emission rates (66 ± 20 nmol m−2 d−1) were observed from
  ornithogenic soil on the island populated with penguins, which was rich in
  organic matter and halides coming from penguin excrements. It is estimated
  that Antarctic tundra emits up to 0.1 Gg CHCl3 per year, which is an important
  source for regional atmospheric CHCl3. Laboratory-based incubations suggested
  that organic carbon and chlorine inputs by penguins may stimulate O2 dependent
  microbial-mediated CHCl3 emission from the Antarctic tundra, and all tundra
  soils showed the maximum CHCl3 emission at 4°C. The strength of this CHCl3
  source is also expected to change in response to Antarctic warming.
