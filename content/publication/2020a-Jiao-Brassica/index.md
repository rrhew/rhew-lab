abstract: Global budgets of methyl halides are not balanced between currently identified sources and sinks. Among biological sources, rapeseed is regarded
  as the second largest terrestrial source of CH3Br, extrapolated from laboratory-based incubations and limited field measurements. This study analyzes   the CH3Br budget from rapeseed (Brassica napus “Empire”), using field-based life cycle measurements, yielding a globally scaled emission rate of 2.8 ± 0.7 Gg year−1. Though this verifies that rapeseed is a significant global source, it is just half of the previous estimation, even after accounting for the doubling of global annual rapeseed production since then. The ozone-depleting potential of rapeseed is further sustained through CH3Cl and CH3I emissions, which were measured for the first time and scaled to 5.3 ± 1.3 and 4.0 ± 0.8 Gg year−1 globally.
