**2003-2025 UC BERKELEY:**  Department of Geography in McCone Hall
**Laboratory facilities:** a 'wet' lab for treatment of soils and plant samples and field equipment, and a 'dry' gas lab consisting of a temperature controlled room housing multiple gas chromatography stations and equipment

**2025-PRESENT SCRIPPS INSTITUTION OF OCEANOGRAPHY**  New trace gas biogeochemistry laboratory under development
**Laboratory facilities (planned):** a temperature controlled room housing 2 gas chromatographs and 1 laser-based instrument, incubation setups.  An additional 'wet' lab for treatment of soils and plant samples and sam

**Belonging:** Our lab group strongly believes in providing an environment that respects the diversity of the members of the group and the community within which we work. In order to thrive, all lab members must feel that their workplace, either on campus or in the field, are safe and welcoming places. Our lab has hosted many scholars who are underrepresented in the STEM disciplines, including women, first-gen, LGBTQ and BIPOC scholars. We can and will improve support for our scholars, in the classroom and in the field, by adopting practices that improve inclusivity and that seek to account for historical disparities in access and opportunity.
