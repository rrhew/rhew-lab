Professor Robert Rhew is the Principal Investigator of the Atmospheric Biogeochemistry Laboratory.  The lab was established in 2003 in the Department of Geography and consists of two adjoining laboratories: a 'wet' lab for treatment of soils and plant samples and field equipment, and a 'dry' lab consisting of a temperature controlled room that houses the gas chromatography instrumentation.
