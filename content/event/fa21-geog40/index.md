summary: (Fall 2021)- GEOG 40 - **Introduction to Earth System Science**
abstract: "This is a survey course of Earth System Science, an interdisciplinary field that explores the functions and interactions of the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, cryosphere, and lithosphere.  We will learn about how the atmosphere, oceans and lithospheric plates move; about the history of life and climate on our planet; and about the modern issues of climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, and biodiversity loss.  We will develop an understanding of how the earth works, as a system.  There are no listed prerequisites for this course, although it will involve some background knowledge in algebra, chemistry, biology and physics.  Diligence and an inquisitive nature are perhaps even more important.  This course meets the L&S Physical Science and Biological Science Breadth Requirements."
