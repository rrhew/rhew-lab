(May 5, 2025) We welcomed 5 new undergraduate researchers to the lab:  Emily Savrnoch, James Li, Carissa Loverme, Ella Herbert, and Sia Agarwal. They joined continuing undergrads Selena Shen, Charlie Diaz, and Tiana Salisbury, and graduate student Will Riley.  This team of 9 outstanding students worked with, and learned from, each other.  Among the many activities this semester, our student researchers presented at the Berkeley Atmospheric Sciences Center (BASC) Symposium, volunteered at Cal Day, conducted field work at an oak savanna woodland and at the Berkeley Marina, and of course, exercised team building over lunch. <br>
