(September 18, 2023) Welcome to the new Atmospheric Biogeochemistry URAP cohort for fall 2023. These 5 undergraduates join the laboratory with a variety of backgrounds and majors. All bring with them a commitment to careful scientific research, intellectual curiosity, and academic excellence.

The Atmospheric Biogeochemistry Laboratory has recently been taken over by these undergraduate researchers:
Tyler Liu, Senior, Chemistry and Music
Taleen Cochran, senior, Environmental Engineering Science
Selena Shen, Junior, Chemical Engineering (Minor in Data Science)
Genevieve (Gigi) Porter, Senior, Environmental Earth Science and French
Charlie Diaz, Sophomore, Environmental Earth Science and Marine Science.

These 5 new members were selected through the competitive Undergraduate Research Apprenticeship Program (URAP). We immediately started working on characterizing, calibrating, and fixing two laser based instruments to measure CO2, CH4, CO and H2O. We will soon be developing equipment to handle incubations of wetland soils, which will be used to study hydrologic regulation of trace gas emissions.
