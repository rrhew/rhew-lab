(July 1, 2022) Rob completed his 5-year appointment as the Faculty Director of the Central Sierra Field Stations (Sagehen Creek Field Station, Central Sierra Snow Lab, Onion Creek Experimental Forest, North Fork Association Lands, and the Chickering Reserve).

Rhew's main activities as Faculty Director were: to support existing projects with our long-serving station managers (Jeff Brown, Faerthen Felix and Randall Osterhuber); to create faculty advisory committees for Sagehen and the Snow Lab; to achieve financial stability in the face of significant budget reductions; to recruit and appoint outstanding new station managers for Sagehen and the Snow Lab (upon the retirement of both sets of station managers); to strengthen connections between these remote reserves and partners in research, teaching and service; and to serve as de facto station manager for 16- and 12-month periods for the Snow Lab and Sagehen, respectively, during the COVID-19 pandemic.  

Rhew is pleased to leave the Central Sierra Field Stations in most capable hands. The new station managers (Dr. Ash Zemenick at Sagehen Creek Field Station and Dr. Andrew Schwartz at the Snow Lab) have recently celebrated the completion of their successful first year, and in that time, they have brought many new directions of emphasis to their field stations.  We welcome the arrival of the new Faculty Director, Prof. Neil Tsutsui (ESPM), who starts his term on July 1, 2022.
