(Dec 2019) Summary of Fall 2019
<!--more-->

**Aug 28 2019:  First day of classes Fall 2019**

Prof. Rhew's course, [Global Change Biogeochemistry](https://rhewlab.netlify.app/event/sp22-geog143/) (Geog 143), features field work at Oxford Tract, new OOI database widgets, a new lecture on air-sea gas exchange, and a new lecture on the changing Arctic biogeochemistry.  (Unfortunatley, this semester also featured a couple disruptive external events, with preventative PG&E power shutdowns to avert potential wildfire events).

**Aug 31-Sept 2, 2019:  GETH weekend at Blodgett Forest**
The Global Environmental Theme House hosted its first weekend trip to Blodgett Forest, coordinated by the Theme Program staff and Prof. Kate O’Neill (ESPM). 

**Welcome new URAP students**: Thee new undergraduate researchers have joined the lab this fall: Metta Nicholson, Phoebe Gross and Sang Hyun Ma. They join our returning group of researchers: Ryan, Dre, Flora and Cooper. Welcome!

**Sept 28-29, 2019.  Baird Graduate awards annual presentations at Sagehen Creek Field Station** Sagehen Creek Field Station was proud to host the 2nd annual Baird-fest, celebrating the graduate student research supported by the Carol Baird Graduate Student Award for Field Research.

**Oct 7-9, 2019.  UCAR Annual Members Meeting in Boulder, CO**

**Nov 13-14, 2019.  Red Card Training at Sagehen** taught by members of the Hotshots and USDA Forest Service workers.  “In response to past disasters, and so that they can keep themselves and their co-workers safe, wildland firefighters working on public lands must be trained to understand fire behavior, and how to manage risk. The certification obtained after completing this training, which allows one to work as a wildland firefighter (or as a member of a fuels crew) is called a Red Card.”
