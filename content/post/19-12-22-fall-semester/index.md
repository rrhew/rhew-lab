**Nov 13-14, 2019.  Red Card Training at Sagehen**   Rob participates in the Red Card Training at Sagehen, taught by members of the Hotshots and USDA Forest Service workers.  “In response to past disasters, and so that they can keep themselves and their co-workers safe, wildland firefighters working on public lands must be trained to understand fire behavior, and how to manage risk. The certification obtained after 
completing this training, which allows one to work as a wildland firefighter (or as a member of a fuels crew) is called a Red Card.”
