This paper by Xiaoyi Hu, Bo Yao, Jens Mühle, Robert Rhew, Paul Fraser, Simon O’Doherty, Ronald Prinn & Xuekun Fang presents a remarkable dataset of CH<sub>3</sub>Br concentrations from a network of stations across China. The observational data combined with inversion (top-down) techniques reveal large and unexplained emissions of methyl bromide from the eastern provinces of China. The top down emission estimates exceed the bottom up estimates by 5.5 Gg/yr, and these are currently unexplained.  They may represent unreported or previously unknown emissions from anthropogenic sources.
