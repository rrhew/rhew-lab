Julian's outstanding paper, Ecosystem-Scale Measurements of Methyl Halide Fluxes From a Brackish Tidal Marsh Invaded With Perennial Pepperweed (*Lepidium latifolium*) [link here](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2018JG004536), *Journal of Geophysical Research - Biogeosciences* (2018), was featured today in EOS, the science news magazine published by AGU.  

The article, [Budgeting Ozone-Depleting Emissions from Coastal Tidal Marshes](https://eos.org/research-spotlights/budgeting-ozone-depleting-emissions-from-coastal-tidal-marshes), describes how Julian's work was the first ecosystem-scale evaluation of methyl halide emissions from a coastal wetland.
