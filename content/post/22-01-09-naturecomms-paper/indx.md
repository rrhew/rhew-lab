Yi Jiao's publication in Nature Communications 
('Application of copper(II)-based chemicals induces CH3Br and CH3Cl 
emissions from soil and seawater', by Yi Jiao, Wanying Zhang, Jae Yun Robin Kim, 
Malte Julian Deventer, Julien Vollering, and Robert C. Rhew) 
shows that application of copper chemicals to agricultural soils 
and seawater induces production of CH3Br and CH3Cl, 
major ozone depleting compounds. Cu compounds are fungicides and 
pesticides that are used extensively in both conventional and organic 
agriculture.  With the widespread use of copper in the environment, 
this potentially growing impact should be considered when predicting 
future halogen load and ozone recovery.  
The full paper will be available here with open access 
â€“ https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-27779-3.

This is an important paper that puts a spotlight on an unexpected 
and previously unknown environmental consequence of copper application 
in the environment, and the mechanism of methyl halide production is very 
large such that it could contribute significantly to the 'missing' 
sources of these compounds.  

Yi Jiao (PhD 2021) conducted this work as part of his dissertation 
research and is currently a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Copenhagen. 
Robin Kim and Julien Vollering were undergraduate researchers who conducted work 
as part of their senior theses.  Julian Deventer was a post-doctoral researcher 
in our laboratory, and Wanying Zhang was a visiting graduate student to our laboratory.
