Congratulations to Dr. Yi Jiao!
<!--more-->

Yi Jiao received his Ph.D. this month from the University of California at Berkeley.  
His dissertation was titled: The Breathing of Halogenated Volatile Organic Compounds (HVOCs) from Human-impacted Ecosystems,[escholarship] (https://escholarship.org/uc/item/94k0r1dx).  


His dissertation work produced 4 first author papers and 3 additional papers, including:

Jiao, Y., Zhang, W., Kim, J.Y.R., Deventer, M.J., Vollering, J. & Rhew, R.C. (2022) Application of copper(II)-based chemicals induces CH3Br and CH3Cl emissions from soil and seawater. Nature Communications.

Jiao, Y., Acdan, J., Xu, R., Deventer, M.J., Zhang, W. & Rhew, R.C. (2020). Global methyl halide emissions from rapeseed (Brassica napus) using life cycle measurements, Geophysical Research Letters, 47 (19), e2020GL089373.   

Jiao, Y., Ruecker, A., Deventer, M.J., Chow, A.T. & Rhew, R.C. (2018). Halocarbon emissions from a degraded forested wetland in coastal South Carolina impacted by sea level rise. ACS Earth & Space Chemistry, 2 (10), 955-967.    

In addition, Yi was an award winning Graduate Student Instructor, the Lab Safety Manager, and a mentor to a great many undergraduates.  

After a brief stint as a post-doctoral researcher in our laboratory, he has moved on to a post-doctoral research position in the outstanding research team 
of Professor Riikka Rinnan at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, Department of Biology. 

He will be sorely missed and we wish him the best for a promising career in atmospheric sciences and biogeochemistry!
