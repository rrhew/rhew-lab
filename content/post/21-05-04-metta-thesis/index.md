May 2021 "Analyzing Methane Emissions from a Restored Bay Area Wetland" by Metta Nicholson
<!--more-->

**Metta Nicholson** ('21) completed her senior honors thesis for Environmental Science, Policy and Management.  Her research investigated how soil moisture, the presence of veegetaion, and other environmental factors impact methane emissions from wetland soils.  She also measured fluxes of carbon dioxide.  To conduct this research, Metta collected soil cores at Sherman Island, a former agricultural area restored to a wetland in 2015.  Net ecosystem fluxes of methane and CO2 have been measured by Prof. Dennis Baldocchi's group (ESPM).  This study looked at emissions at three different microenvironments:  wet channel, moist channel, and dry upland. Samples were incubated in the laboratory under different conditions and carbon gas fluxes were measured using a Los Gatos Ultraportable Greenhouse Gas Analyzer. Metta was able to complete this work despite slowdowns associated with the very limited access to the research laboratory and field site.  Metta conducted this research as one of the Distinguished Haas scholars, which involved numerous presentations.  Congratulations Metta!
