Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) funds outstanding postdoctoral researchers through the Marie Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship program.  Regarding Marie Curie:  Marie Curie Salomea Skłodowska Curie (1867-1934) was a Polish-French chemist and physicist who pioneered research on radioactivity.  She was the first woman professor at University of Paris, the first woman to win the Nobel Prize, and the only woman to win the [Nobel Prize twice](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1903/marie-curie/biographical/).  She was also the only person to win the Nobel Prize in two different fields.  Her first Nobel Prize in 1903 was in Physics, shared with her husband Pierre Curie, for their study of spontaneous radiation discovered by Henri Becquerel, who received the other half of the Nobel Prize.  Her second Nobel Prize in 1911 was in Chemistry for her discovery of the radioactive elements Polonium and Radium.
