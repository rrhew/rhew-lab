We welcome William Riley to the Atmospheric Biogeochemistry laboratory!  
William has started at U.C. Berkeley as a Ph.D. student in the ESPM Department.

Will immediately jumped right into the work, both as a Graduate Student Instructor and out in the field.
In August, Will was out in the wetlands, measuring methane (CH4) fluxes at Dutch Slough, a restored tidal freshwater marsh in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Bay Delta. This field site is being studied by the Baldocchi Lab (ESPM) for ecosystem scale greenhouse gas fluxes. Our lab is studying the impacts of changing hydrologic conditions on soil methane fluxes.
