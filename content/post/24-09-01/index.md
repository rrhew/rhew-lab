(Aug 26, 2024) William Riley in the field
<!--more-->
Welcome William Riley to UC Berkeley and the Atmospheric Biogeochemistry laboratory!  
Will arrives to Berkeley as a first year Ph.D. student in the ESPM Department.  
<p>
He immediately jumped right into the work, both as a Graduate Student Instructor and out in the field.
<p>
Here Will is measuring methane (CH4) fluxes at Dutch Slough, a restored tidal freshwater 
marsh in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Bay Delta. This field site is being studied by the Baldocchi Lab (ESPM)
  for ecosystem scale methane fluxes. Our lab is studying the impacts of changing hydrologic conditions 
  on soil methane fluxes.
