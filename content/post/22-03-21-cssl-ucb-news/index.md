(Mar 21, 2022) Excellent story and video about Dr. Andrew Schwartz and Snow Lab: [With climate change, Berkeley snow labâ€™s mission remains critical](https://news.berkeley.edu/2022/03/21/with-climate-change-berkeley-snow-labs-mission-remains-critical/).

This very timely new story by Bob Sanders and video by Roxanne Makasdjian and Jason Blalock highlight the work done by the 
new manager of the Central Sierra Snow Lab, Dr. Andrew Schwartz, and the new collaboration for 3-D printed weather stations
with the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Andrew arrived in April 2021, revitalizing the Snow Lab after a year of 
near closure and bringing in exciting research collaborations, effective communication tools, outreach efforts and cutting edge research.

This winter has been one for the record books, with the
snowiest December on record (214" in December 2021), followed by the longest streak (37 consecutive days) of no precipitation 
winter days, beating out the prior record of 31 days in 1990.  We are now below average for snowpack and snow water equivalent, 
dashing hopes of ending this California drought.  Andrew has been extremely busy doing measurements, hosting researchers 
and classes, and fielding media requests from around the country and world (see the facebook and twitter site for links 
to many of them).
