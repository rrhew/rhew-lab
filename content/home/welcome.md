Our **Atmospheric (Trace gas) Biogeochemistry Laboratory** quantifies sources and sinks 
of environmentally important trace gases, determines the biological and 
environmental controls on those fluxes, identifies the biochemical and abiotic 
mechanisms involved, and assesses impacts of land use and climate change on emissions.
