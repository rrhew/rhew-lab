In our **Trace Gas Biogeochemistry Laboratory** we quantify sources and sinks 
of environmentally important trace gases, determine the biological and 
environmental controls on those fluxes, identify the biochemical and abiotic 
mechanisms involved, and assess impacts of land use and climate change on emissions.
